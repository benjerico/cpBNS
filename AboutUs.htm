            <p><span class="BNSwords">Ben Holmgren</span>. Developer. Blacksmith. Renaissance man. Ben wears more hats than a sombrero model,
             and he wouldn't have it any other way. With a stalwart base of knowledge, life experience, and creative prowess, Ben attacks
             development projects like a kung-fu master. His nickname, "WebFoo", is no surprise. Beneath the rough exterior lies a refreshing spring
             of kindness, determination, and steadfast loyalty. A self-starter with a keen eye for detail, Ben is the rudder for your project. 
             As the winds of life blow, let Ben be your sail. So sit back, relax, and prepare for a horizon littered with possibility.</p>

            <p><span class="BNSwords">Scott Duncan</span>. "Anything worth doing, is worth doing well." Coming from a manufacturing background, 
            Scott has the ability to fine tune your project with a precision rivled only by a Swiss watchmaker. With a healthy dose of obsessive 
            compulsion, laser focus, and creative musings, you can be sure that no detail will be left untouched. Scott has often been acused 
            of thinking more like a computer than a human, and as such, he's mentally indestructable. All of his windows are covered, his clocks 
            are broken, and he only eats once a week. This lifestyle provides ample time to tackle any development project, big or small. Why risk 
            human influence when you can have a bio-robot flawlessly solve all of your development riddles? Easy answer: you wouldn't.</p>
